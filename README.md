# Pico Challenges

You can find some of the interesting challenges I completed in [pico](https://picoctf.org)

In completed challenge directories (i.e `./inter_enc_COMPLETE`) you may(based on the challenge) find:

- challenge files
- `get_flag` shell script

Running the `./get_flag` script will walk you through the process of getting the flag
